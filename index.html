				<h3>Free User</h3>
				<p>This application uses various metrics including sentiment analysis to help assess buy and sell scenarios. We provide a live twitters sentiment analysis in addition to a longer time frame analysis of Reddit sentiment in our free version. Our premium features include a STAK score which is composed with a proprietary algorithm which scores every listed equity based on financials, sentiment, risk-profile, and technical analysis.</p>

				<h3>Premium User</h3>
				<p>Social sentiment indicators are based on information users post publicly to Facebook, Twitter, blog posts, discussion groups and forums. If the social sentiment indicator shows a negative change in direction, a stock is most likely in a sell situation, in the positive, a buy. Our sentiment model uses a modified version of the popular natural language toolkit sentiment model called Vader. We tested the perfomance of this model against various other sentiment classifiers.</p>
